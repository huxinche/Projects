                    <p>Many people asked me："Why I change my major to Information Systems?".The reason is I really
                        want to
                        be the person who not only know the management knowledge but have deep
                        understand the technical knowledge. I think supply chain are highly connected with technical
                        fields,
                        like big data, software and AI. Nowadays pretty much everything is connected with technology
                        and
                        data. In my undergraduate study, I learned how to apply programming knowledge to solve
                        problems in real life.
                        How to make a responsive website and mobile App from front-end to back-end.</p>
